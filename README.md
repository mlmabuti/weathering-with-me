## Information

This weather application is made to mess around with the weatherstack and mapbox APIs. The latter is used to geocode the location in order to use the requested coordinates on weatherstack.

Note: This app is using "free" API subscriptions. Mapbox offers 100,000 free requests/month, unfortunately, Weatherstack only allows 250 free requests/month which means there will be times when the service will not be available. With that said, I'd appreciate if you do not spam requests to let other visitors try the app.

## Possible updates

* Clean up the code.
* Use express Router object.
* Replace callbacks with promises.
